      In 2018, Wade Wilson uses Cable's time-travel device to save his girlfriend Vanessa Carlysle's life and travels to Earth-616, the "Sacred Timeline," to join the Avengers. However, he is rejected by Happy Hogan and returns to his own universe. Six years later, Wade retires from being the Deadpool and works as a used-car salesman with his friend Peter Wisdom. During his birthday party, the Time Variance Authority (TVA) captures him and brings him to Mr. Paradox, who reveals that Wade's timeline is deteriorating due to the death of its stabilizing anchor being, Logan. Paradox plans to use a "Time Ripper" to speed up the process, and Wade steals Paradox's TemPad to travel to Logan's grave. Wade and Logan are captured and taken to the Void, where Alioth consumes everything. They meet a resistance group, and Wade proposes an alliance to fight Cassandra. Cassandra learns about Paradox's plan and plans to destroy all timelines, leaving only the Void. Wade and Logan destroy the Time Ripper, saving their lives.
